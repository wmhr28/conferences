# CONFERENCE TRACK MANAGEMENT
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

* The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
* Each session contains multiple talks.
* Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
* Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
* The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
* No talk title has numbers in it.
* All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
* Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

**Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you donâ€™t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.**

### Installation

Unzip the contents of the file conferences.zip, enter the folder "target" there you will find the file conferences-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar is the executable file that starts the Conferences system, need a txt file with the events.

### Usage
```bash
java -jar conferences-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Enter a file path:

Enter a file path:  C:\Users\wm_herrera\Documents\NetBeansProjects\conferences\src\main\resources\conference1.txt
```
### Test files
I have created a set of files to do tests, they are in the following path

src\main\resources
and 
target\classes
```
